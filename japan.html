        Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous
        metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23
        central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the
        city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.
        <span class="show-more-target">
          <br />
          Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping,
          entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history
          can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent
          museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception,
          Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city
          center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.

        Kyoto (京都, Kyōto) served as Japan's capital and the emperor's
        residence from 794 until 1868. It is one of the country's ten largest
        cities with a population of 1.5 million people and a modern face.
        <span class="show-more-target">
          <br />
          Over the centuries, Kyoto was destroyed by many wars and fires, but
          due to its exceptional historic value, the city was dropped from the
          list of target cities for the atomic bomb and escaped destruction
          during World War II. Countless temples, shrines and other historically
          priceless structures survive in the city today.

        Osaka (大阪, Ōsaka) is Japan's second largest metropolitan area after
        Tokyo. It has been the economic powerhouse of the Kansai Region for many
        centuries. Osaka was formerly known as Naniwa. Before the Nara Period,
        when the capital used to be moved with the reign of each new emperor,
        Naniwa was once Japan's capital city, the first one ever known.
        <span class="show-more-target">
          <br />
          In the 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi chose Osaka as the location
          for his castle, and the city may have become Japan's political capital
          if Tokugawa Ieyasu had not terminated the Toyotomi lineage after
          Hideyoshi's death and moved his government to distant Edo (Tokyo).
